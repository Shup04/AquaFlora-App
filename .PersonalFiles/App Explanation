The app will be for managing consumer aquariums and fish tanks.
Users wil be able to add their aquariums, and then add fish and plants to each aquarium.
Some features i have written down to add are (at least for the MVP):
- Notifications to do waterchanges, maintenance, etc.
- Parameter tracking on a graph
- notifications of parameters become out of healthy range.
- fish and plant database for easy adding.
Thats just the basics, you can fill in other mandatory features if you think of them.

Feature Queue (in order)
